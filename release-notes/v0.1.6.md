# Release Notes - v0.1.6

## Features

### Enhanced Update Progress Monitoring
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Added comprehensive real-time monitoring for nodegroup updates with live progress display
- **Interactive Tree View**: Implemented tree-structured progress display similar to the list command for consistent UI
- **Flexible Wait Options**: New `--no-wait` flag allows users to start updates and exit immediately (original behavior)
- **Quiet Mode**: Added `--quiet` flag for minimal output during operations
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Added `--timeout` flag to control maximum wait time (default: 40 minutes)
- **Custom Poll Intervals**: Added `--poll-interval` flag to adjust update status checking frequency (default: 15 seconds)

### Improved User Experience
- **Graceful Interruption**: Added signal handling (Ctrl+C) to stop monitoring while keeping updates running
- **Completion Summary**: Comprehensive summary showing final status of all updates with success/failure counts
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error reporting with retry logic and exponential backoff
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual status indicators for different update states (IN PROGRESS, SUCCESSFUL, FAILED, CANCELLED)

### Technical Improvements
- **Concurrent Monitoring**: Support for monitoring multiple nodegroup updates simultaneously
- **Robust Error Recovery**: Added retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for AWS API calls
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized display updates to prevent memory accumulation during long-running operations

## Technical Details

### New Command Flags
- `--no-wait`: Don't wait for update completion (restores original behavior)
- `--quiet`: Minimal output mode
- `--timeout`: Maximum time to wait for update completion (default: 40m)
- `--poll-interval`: Polling interval for checking update status (default: 15s)

### New Data Structures
- `UpdateProgress`: Tracks individual nodegroup update progress
- `ProgressMonitor`: Manages multiple concurrent updates
- `MonitorConfig`: Configuration for monitoring behavior

### Enhanced Output Format
- Tree-structured progress display with consistent formatting
- Real-time updates with terminal clearing for live progress
- Color-coded status indicators for better visibility
- Elapsed time tracking for both individual updates and overall operation

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Start update and monitor progress (new default behavior)
refresh update --cluster my-cluster --nodegroup my-nodegroup

# Start update and exit immediately (original behavior)
refresh update --cluster my-cluster --nodegroup my-nodegroup --no-wait

# Monitor with custom timeout and polling interval
refresh update --cluster my-cluster --nodegroup my-nodegroup --timeout 60m --poll-interval 30s

# Quiet mode for minimal output
refresh update --cluster my-cluster --nodegroup my-nodegroup --quiet
```

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed output formatting and display consistency
- Improved error handling during AWS API calls
- Enhanced signal handling for graceful shutdown

## Notes
- The default behavior has changed from fire-and-forget to monitoring updates until completion
- Use `--no-wait` flag to restore the original behavior of starting updates without waiting
- Updates will continue running in AWS even if monitoring is interrupted
- Use `refresh list` to manually check update status at any time
