# EKS Nodegroup Management Ideas

This document outlines potential features and capabilities that can be added to the `refresh` CLI tool for enhanced EKS nodegroup AMI rotation and management.

## Nodegroup Scaling & Management

### Dynamic Scaling Commands
- **Scale nodegroups before/after AMI updates**: Add `--scale-to` and `--restore-scale` flags to temporarily adjust capacity during rotations
- **Intelligent scaling**: Automatically scale up before updates to maintain capacity, then scale back down
- **Scaling validation**: Verify Auto Scaling Group limits before attempting scaling operations

### Spot Instance Management
- **Spot instance conversion**: Convert nodegroups between on-demand and spot instances during AMI updates
- **Spot savings analysis**: Calculate and display potential cost savings when using spot instances
- **Spot interruption handling**: Monitor and report on spot instance interruption rates

### Instance Type Optimization
- **Alternative instance type suggestions**: Recommend cost-effective alternatives during AMI updates
- **Performance impact analysis**: Compare CPU, memory, and network performance between instance types
- **Compatibility validation**: Ensure suggested instance types support the required AMI and EKS version

### Multi-AZ Coordination
- **Availability zone distribution**: Ensure proper node distribution across AZs during rolling updates
- **AZ-aware rolling updates**: Update one AZ at a time to maintain availability
- **Cross-AZ failover validation**: Verify workloads can handle temporary AZ unavailability

## Health Monitoring & Safety

### Pre-flight Health Checks
- **Nodegroup health validation**: Use CloudWatch Container Insights to verify cluster health before updates
- **Resource utilization checks**: Ensure sufficient capacity exists before starting rotations
- **Dependency validation**: Check for critical system pods and workloads

### Pod Disruption Budget Validation
- **PDB compliance checking**: Validate that AMI rotations won't violate existing PDBs
- **Workload impact assessment**: Identify which applications might be affected by node draining
- **PDB recommendation engine**: Suggest PDB configurations for workloads without them

### Rolling Update Monitoring
- **Real-time progress tracking**: Monitor update progress using EKS APIs with live status updates
- **Health check integration**: Continuously monitor node and pod health during updates
- **Update velocity control**: Adjust update speed based on cluster health metrics

### Rollback Capabilities
- **Automatic failure detection**: Identify failed AMI updates and trigger rollback procedures
- **Rollback automation**: Automatically revert to previous AMI version if issues are detected
- **Rollback validation**: Verify cluster health after rollback operations

## Cost Analysis & Reporting

### Cost Impact Analysis
- **AMI cost comparison**: Use Cost Explorer API to compare costs between old and new AMI configurations
- **Total cost of ownership**: Factor in compute, storage, and network costs for different AMI options
- **Cost trend analysis**: Show historical cost trends for nodegroup configurations

### Rotation Cost Estimation
- **Temporary capacity costs**: Calculate additional costs during rolling updates (duplicate capacity)
- **Downtime cost analysis**: Estimate business impact costs of different update strategies
- **Update window optimization**: Recommend cost-effective update scheduling

### Savings Reports
- **Spot vs on-demand analysis**: Compare current pricing with spot instance alternatives
- **Right-sizing recommendations**: Suggest optimal instance types based on actual usage
- **Reserved instance optimization**: Identify opportunities for RI purchases

### Cost Allocation Tags
- **Automatic tagging**: Apply cost allocation tags during AMI rotations for better tracking
- **Tag compliance**: Ensure all nodegroup resources have required cost allocation tags
- **Billing integration**: Generate reports compatible with AWS Cost Explorer and billing tools

## Advanced AMI Management

### AMI Vulnerability Scanning
- **Security patch comparison**: Compare security updates between current and latest AMIs
- **CVE tracking**: Identify critical vulnerabilities addressed in new AMI versions
- **Compliance reporting**: Generate security compliance reports for AMI versions

### Custom AMI Support
- **Custom AMI validation**: Verify custom AMIs meet EKS requirements before deployment
- **AMI testing framework**: Automated testing of custom AMIs in isolated environments
- **AMI lifecycle management**: Track custom AMI versions and deprecation schedules

### AMI Lifecycle Tracking
- **AMI age monitoring**: Track how long current AMIs have been in use
- **Deprecation alerts**: Warn when AMIs are approaching end-of-life
- **Update scheduling**: Automatically schedule updates based on AMI lifecycle policies

### Patch Compliance Reporting
- **Security update tracking**: Identify which nodegroups need critical security updates
- **Compliance dashboards**: Generate visual reports of patch compliance across clusters
- **Automated compliance notifications**: Alert when nodegroups fall out of compliance

## Operational Intelligence

### Capacity Planning
- **Resource utilization analysis**: Analyze CPU, memory, and storage usage patterns
- **Scaling recommendations**: Suggest optimal nodegroup sizing based on actual usage
- **Growth projection**: Predict future capacity needs based on usage trends

### Update Scheduling
- **Traffic pattern analysis**: Use CloudWatch metrics to identify optimal update windows
- **Maintenance window planning**: Schedule updates during low-traffic periods
- **Update coordination**: Coordinate updates across multiple clusters and regions

### Blast Radius Control
- **Concurrent update limits**: Limit how many nodegroups update simultaneously
- **Dependency-aware updates**: Consider application dependencies when scheduling updates
- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate potential impact of simultaneous failures

### CI/CD Integration
- **Pipeline status export**: Export update status for integration with deployment pipelines
- **Webhook notifications**: Send update status to external systems
- **GitOps integration**: Integrate with GitOps workflows for declarative nodegroup management

## Kubernetes-Native Features

### Safe Node Draining
- **PDB-aware draining**: Respect Pod Disruption Budgets during node drainage
- **Graceful pod eviction**: Handle pod termination gracefully with proper shutdown procedures
- **Drain timeout handling**: Manage situations where pods cannot be evicted within timeout

### Workload Impact Analysis
- **Application dependency mapping**: Identify which applications run on nodes being updated
- **Service disruption prediction**: Predict which services might be affected by updates
- **Critical workload protection**: Ensure critical system workloads remain available

### Node Cordoning/Uncordoning
- **Manual node control**: Provide commands for manual node cordoning and uncordoning
- **Maintenance mode**: Put nodes in maintenance mode without triggering automatic replacements
- **Node status tracking**: Monitor and display current node scheduling status

### Pod Restart Coordination
- **Restart orchestration**: Coordinate pod restarts to minimize application downtime
- **Rolling restart capabilities**: Restart application pods in a controlled manner
- **Startup sequence management**: Ensure proper application startup order after restarts
